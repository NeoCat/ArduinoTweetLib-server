*** arduino-tweet server for GAE ***
This code is a server for ArduinoTweetLib for Google AppEngine.


*** How to get started

1. Install google-appengine SDK from https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads

2. Put your Twitter API Consumer key/secret into `twitter_oauth_handler.py'.

3. Create your own application on GAE at: https://appengine.google.com/

4. In Twitter app settings, set `Callback URL' to your application:
    http://your-app-name.appspot.com/oauth/twitter/callback

5. Change your application name in `app.yaml'.

6. Start app server at localhost to try out.
  $ dev_appserver.py .
  After authentication, it will be redirected to your-app-name.appspot.com and authentication error occurs. You need to rewrite URL to localhost:8080 etc. manually.

7. Deploy the application to GAE.
  $ appcfg.py update .
