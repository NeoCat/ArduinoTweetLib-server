About This Version
===================

Arduino Ethernet is originally distributed at http://gkaindl.com/software/arduino-ethernet.
In this version, EthernetDNS library is patched for DNS CNAME support. (see cname-support.patch)


Installation
============

To install the libraries, you need to place the folders contained within the download zip into your "libraries" folder. You can find it within your Arduino IDE distribution within the "hardware" folder. Be sure to restart the IDE if it was running.

On a Mac, you will want to create a folder named "libraries" in in the "Documents" -> "Arduino" folder within your home directory. Place the folders contained in the download zip there (and restart the IDE, if it was running during this process).
